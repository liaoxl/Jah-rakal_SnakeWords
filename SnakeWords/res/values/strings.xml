  	This is a game that extends the classic "Greedy Snake". 
  	You have to control the snake to eat apples in an order such that 
  	the letters in the snake body make up a word of which the Chinese 
  	meaning is given.\n
  	Just as the classic game, you have to avoid collision with the wall 
  	and the snake itself during the moving. We add a new feature of "regret": 
  	you can give up an apple already eaten by eating an "@". Eat the "$" when 
  	you are finished with a word.\n
  	Move Instructions: \n
  	. use direction key(up, down, left, right) to move the snake;\n
  	. press ENTER to start/pause/resume game;\n
  	. use MENU for other functions; \n
